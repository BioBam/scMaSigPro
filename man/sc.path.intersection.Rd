\title{Perform UpSet Plot on Intersection of Significant Genes from SCMP Object}
\usage{
sc.path.intersection(scmpObj)
}
\arguments{
\item{scmpObj}{An object of class SCMP, which should contain the @siggenes@summary slot
filled with the summary of significant genes for each pathway.}
}
\value{
An UpSet plot visualizing the intersections of significant genes across pathways.
}
\description{
This function takes a Single Cell MultiPathway (SCMP) object, extracts the list of
significant genes for each pathway, and performs an UpSet plot to visualize their intersections.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'scmp_object' is a pre-processed SCMP object with the relevant slots filled
sc.path.intersection(scmp_object)
}
