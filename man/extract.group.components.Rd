\title{Extract Group Components Function}
\usage{
extract.group.components(coeff.vec, groups)
}
\arguments{
\item{coeff.vec}{A numeric vector representing the coefficient estimates.}

\item{groups}{A character vector of length 2, containing the names of the
two groups.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing the extracted group components A
        and B, with appropriate names.
}
\description{
This function takes a coefficient vector and groups as input and extracts the
group components A and B based on the provided grouping information. It
assigns appropriate names to the components and combines them into a single
vector.
}
\examples{
# Assuming coeff.vec is a numeric vector of coefficient estimates, and
# groups is a character vector of length 2.
# Extract the group components
components <- extract.group.components(coeff.vec, groups = c("GroupA", "GroupB"))
print(components)
