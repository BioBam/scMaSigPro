\title{Perform UpSet Plot on Intersection of Significant Genes from SCMP Object}
\usage{
plotIntersect(
  scmpObj,
  min_interaction_size = 2,
  keep_empty_groups = TRUE,
  width_ratio = 0.1,
  show_sets_size = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scmpObj}{An object of class SCMP, which should contain the @siggenes@summary slot
filled with the summary of significant genes for each pathway.}

\item{min_interaction_size}{description}

\item{keep_empty_groups}{description}

\item{width_ratio}{description}

\item{show_sets_size}{description}
}
\value{
An UpSet plot visualizing the intersections of significant genes across pathways.
}
\description{
This function takes a Single Cell MultiPathway (SCMP) object, extracts the list of
significant genes for each pathway, and performs an UpSet plot to visualize their intersections.
