\usage{
showCoeff(scmpObj, view = FALSE, return = TRUE, includeInflu = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scmpObj}{an object of class 'scmp'. This object should contain the computed solution.}

\item{view}{logical, whether to view the solution. If TRUE (default), the solution is displayed.}

\item{return}{logical, whether to return the solution. If FALSE (default), the solution is not returned.}

\item{includeInflu}{description}
}
\value{
The computed solution as a data.frame if return is set to TRUE.
If return is FALSE, the function does not return anything.
}
\description{
This function is used to view or return the coeffients of the provided scMaSigPro object.
